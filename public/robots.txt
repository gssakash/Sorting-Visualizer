Challenges I Faced : 


--Delaying of the Time for animations : 

I faced an issue with making the animations stick for each comparison and swap that takes place 
and ultimately i ended up fixing it by multiplying the time delay with the index of the array element so that the timeout would be applied for every index.
Note : This happened because for loops are synchronous and they have absolutely no time delay so for the time delay i did the above.

--Keeping track of the color of the elements while comparing them : 

I had an issue with changing the color of the element while they're being compared as i had to revert them back to their original color after the comparison is done
So, i decided to first push the color aka yellow which is to be shown when the elements are being compared and then make them their original color after the comparison finishes

--Not being able to keep track of the indices when the values are being compared. 

I faced an issue with implementing this visualizer for selection sort and insertion sort as I was not able to detect the indices 
where i was supposed to perform the color change (to yellow) which is used to show that the values are being compared against each other 
after which the values are changed back to the original color
so, i decided to use the strings (comparison1, comparison2) instead of keeping track of the indices where the values are being compared with each other. 
And, i've also added other strings which can legit have any value to avoid further errors.
